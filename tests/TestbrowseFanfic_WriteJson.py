browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Mumu", "Le Sarongla, Vacorina", "28/02/2025", "Hồ Quang Dũng","When they said life after death, Lea didn’t take that quite literally that she’d be stuck in a place where nobody could see her. She thought she was going straight to the heavens (God forbid she falls down the pit) but on the contrary, there she was, in limbo, being able to touch, feel, and see (she hoped she could eat but the food just kept on passing through) but nobody could see her. In short, she was a ghost. Although it did come with perks, like being able to watch a concert for free, it did tend to get a little too boring. She thought she’d meet new ghost besties but as it turned out, she was all alone. So what she did... well what did ghost do? She had no idea. When she was alive, there would have been a multitude of things to do, in fact, her to-do-list never really ran out. But now that she was a mumu , she was left empty-handed. She didn’t imagine ghost life to be quite boring but then she realized that she could stir up mischief and nobody would know it was her. When she was alive, she was a goody-two-shoes, that is she feared consequences. But turn about was a fair play, and being literally invisible gave her a pass to do whatever she wanted (except eat, something she was still pissed off about)."))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Rolling down", "Namu, Yerky", "21/01/2025", "Hồ Quang Dũng","She was sitting on the hammock by the front porch when a man arrived. He had his sunglasses on, a Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts paired with loafers (which, if you asked her, wasn’t really practical given that there were sand everywhere). He climbed up the stairs and fiddled with his keys as he tried to open the door. He had sighed for the nth time so she went closer to see him. She scanned his being. He was tall, very mestizo, he was brawny which had her thinking that beneath the shirt was a chiselled chest… probably abs too, and she couldn’t deny that he was pleasing to the eyes.She sat across him when he ate his dinner, almost jealous of him for being able to shovel down his throat that scrumptious looking steak. Her mouth watered the entire time. Why couldn’t she at least be allowed to eat ghost food?"))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Delulu", "Loki, Thor", "17/01/2025", "Bùi Đức Minh","It had all started a few days ago when he saw his younger brother, Loki, getting out of a black luxury car parked discreetly at a corner, far from the view of their classmates. The driver, an older man with an extravagant demeanor, had exchanged a look with Loki before the boy hurried toward the school building. Thor hadn’t mentioned it at the time, but the image haunted him like a thorn lodged in his mind.Since then, Loki had been more distant than usual. Thor was used to his sarcasm and his way of keeping to himself, but now it seemed as though his brother was carrying a secret that was consuming him. That morning, as Thor passed by his locker, he noticed something strange: Loki was looking at his phone with an expression that flickered between anxiety and weariness. As Thor approached to greet him, Loki immediately turned off the screen and muttered an excuse before walking away. Thor sighed, leaning against the lockers. It wasn’t easy being the older brother of someone like Loki. There was always a wall between them, a barrier built over years of rivalry, secrets, and Loki’s relentless need to prove he didn’t need anyone. But Thor knew better. Something was wrong."))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Infinity", "James Potter, Regulus Black", "04/02/2025", "Bùi Đức Minh","It's been nearly a week of days spent walking from dawn 'til dusk and nights spent sleeping restlessly on the forest floor, and James is starting to think that this quest of his maybe wasn't the best idea.It seemed simple enough in theory – travel north until he finds the shooting star he'd seen fall from the sky last Sunday, bring the star back with him to Godric's Hollow, and offer the star to Lily Evans in exchange for her hand in marriage, or her affection at the very least – but in practice it's proving more difficult. Perhaps he should have paid more attention to orienteering at school.Any hope he had of actually finding the star is dwindling as the sun sets on another day, when he sees what appears to be a glow on the horizon."))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Milord", "Mira,Uki,Lord Hert", "18/01/2025", "Nguyễn Thị Linh","It should’ve been easy, to say no that is. But when Eddie’s eyes met Steve’s – brown and golden and sincere and mesmerizing – he couldn’t utter a word. Fucking typical. If they were still in high school, he would mask his attraction as something else and sneer at Steve to chase him away, but he couldn’t do that now, could he?So here he is. And he is screwed, so, so, screwed. Because it’s one thing to stare at Steve from a safe distance, eyes trailing down his body and taking him in from afar. Being in his presence is a whole another deal, though.The noise of the opening door drags him out of his thoughts and there he stands, Steve Harrington in all his glory. He’s wearing one of his beloved striped polos and light blue jeans that just hug his thighs perfectly. His hair somehow looks carefully combed and equally tousled and soft and Eddie would give up his entire life to run his fingers through it."))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Vampire", "Steve Harrington, Eddie Munson", "22/02/2025", "Phạm Thị Yến","It has been exactly fifteen days, eight hours and twenty-seven minutes since Eddie managed to miraculously survive being eaten alive. It has also been exactly fourteen days, eight hours and twenty-seven minutes since he realised that he wants to fucking bite Steve Harrington. And not in the cute way.Because sure, he can be honest here – it isn’t the first time he has played around with the thought of biting into the tanned skin on Steve’s neck. He’s not blind, his sight is damn near perfect – however impossible it sounds, it somehow improved since his Upside Down visit, but he is meticulously shoving this piece of information into the back of his mind – and Steve hasn’t spent a day in his life being unattractive. Some people are just meant to walk around looking as perfect as a Greek statue."))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Hey Hey", "John Egbert, Dave Strider, Dirk Strider", "17/01/2025", "Phạm Thị Yến","It was little over a year ago you had begun the adoption process and it took almost everything out of you, eventually leaving you exhausted, anxious, and excited all at once. From the initial filing of papers to the background checks and interviews, even the inspection of your three bedroom home. But unlike most people, you did not have a spouse or significant other. You were, however, sure you had the capability to afford a child considering your profession.The one who gave you the idea to adopt was your cousin, Jake English. A few years before he had adopted a young girl named Jade, it was an odd choice that stood out to you because Jade had different additions compared to Jake. Where your cousin had more cat-like ears and tail, Jade had dog-like ears and tail. Although, now that you think about it, that might have been the decision of his then-girlfriend-now-wife Jane. It confused you as to why they would adopt instead of trying for their own. You shake your head. Maybe she is infertile?"))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("The End", "Hayakawa Aki", "11/01/2025", "Phạm Quốc Bảo","Aki spent his entire trip to Hokkaido thinking about you. When his thoughts begin to wander like this, he isn't given much of a choice; you occupy every space in his mind. Each stream of consciousness always seems to lead right back where he left it — You.Hokkaido is cold, empty, and manages to suck the life out of everything it touches. The sky is a certain shade of melancholy blue and twilight. It's the kind of atmosphere that causes him to slip into his usual routine of drowning in old, tired memories and his own reflections. His heart and his brain don't spare him much pity these days.Frost creeps at the edges of the windows. A veil of snow falls incessantly and swirls with the wind, obscuring any semblance of a view, leaving him only able to see what lingers in the back of his mind: graves made of polished stone, loaded guns, failed attempts to quit smoking, forgetting how to say a prayer because it's been too long. Getting cold feet, and trying to live an honest life, even though you know it's far too late for that. "))
browse_fanfic.append(Draft("Manacled", "Oliver Queen, Felicity Smoak", "14/02/2025", "Phạm Quốc Bảo","Her head hurt. It was becoming a problem, just how often that was happening these days. She’d had some pretty good knocks to the head, and even though she knew that all of the myths about killing brain cells and stuff were just that, head injury was something she’d done a lot of research on ever since joining Team Arrow—if Oliver didn’t like the nickname, he could very well come up with his own—since her position on the team vacillated between excising dead tissue and excising troublesome code. So she’d done her reading, okay? And waking up with her head pounding like this, not a good thing. Not a good thing at all."))
